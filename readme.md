# Steps involved in diffusion based generative modelling
    1. Let N be a neural network that can serially estimate the level/schedule of noise present in the image supplied to it.
    2. The noise estimate is then subtracted with the image to get an estimate of the orignal image (denoised).
    3. Undo k% of the noise and supply the new image into the network and iteratively repeat this process untill we get close of zero% noise.
    4. To condition the generative process we can supply the embeddings of natural language description of image that we want into the network.

# Motivation
    1. Use GA(Genetic Algorithm) to optimize the Inception score of generated images (From diffusion model).
    2. Try out classifier free guidance. This is kind of a hack that is done to amplify the response of network towards the conditioning. In this, one noise is generated by providing the embedding and another without the embedding. The difference of those two noise is then subtracted from the input image. 

# TODO:
    1. Work on the image preprocessing pipeline
        1.1 Basic Image processing and image augmentation code is developed.
        1.2 Start working on imposing noise schedule on the images.
    2. Create the orchestration code.
    3. code out the GA optimization.
